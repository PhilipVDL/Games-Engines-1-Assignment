Procedural generation assignment for Games Engines 1

## What it does
This project aims to procedurally react to the player's location and movements in order to generate a seemingly infinite cityscape of buildings with a non-euclidean interior layout.  
In simpler terms:  
-No matter how far you walk, there will be more cityscape  
-No matter how many times you go up a flight of stairs, or walk to the next room over, there will be more rooms  
-The color and rotation of rooms will be based on what direction you traveled to reach them, even if you go back to the room you just came from.

## What I did VS what I borrowed
### Borrowed:
-First person controller from "Standard Assets" on the Unity asset store.  
-Various free 3D textures from [https://3dtextures.me/](https://3dtextures.me/)  

### DIY:
-All buildings and building segments  
-Code for spawning/despawning building segements  
-Code for color changing based on direction of rooms
