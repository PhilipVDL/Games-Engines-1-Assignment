# Games-Engines-1-Assignment
Procedural generation assignment for Games Engines 1

## What it does
This project aims to procedurally react to the player's location and movements in order to generate a seemingly infinite cityscape of buildings with a non-euclidean interior layout.  
In simpler terms:
-No matter how far you walk, there will be more cityscape
-No matter how many times you go up a flight of stairs, or walk to the next room over, there will be more rooms
-The color and rotation of rooms will be based on what direction you traveled to reach them, even if you go back to the room you just came from.
